Oddisee, a Sudanese-American producer/MC from Washington D.C, has consistently been a favorite rapper/producer of mine over the years, and "Own Appeal" is undeniably one of his standout works. Lately, I've found myself dwelling on the opening line, "I never asked to be born, and death's no question." Today, I finally put pen to paper to share my thoughts on what this line means to me.

### The Unasked Query of Existence

The words resonate deeply - "I never asked to be born." This raw expression encapsulates the unasked nature of our existence, a sentiment many grapple with at some point. 

Oddisee's declaration encapsulates the paradox of choice coloring our journey. Reflecting on life's myriad choices against the backdrop of our lack of agency in our own birth, I recognize that while I navigate decisions, the fundamental choice – the decision to exist – wasn't mine to make.

### Death's Unavoidable Certainty

The latter half, "death's no question," unfolds as a poignant acknowledgment of our mortality. Oddisee lays it bare, prompting a confrontation with the inevitability of death. It's not foreboding but sparks a profound reflection on how I approach life, knowing its finite nature defines our shared human experience.

### Crafting Meaning Through Personal Reflection

Oddisee's words become a soundtrack to my contemplation. How do I navigate this uncharted territory of existence? Finding solace in unique coping mechanisms, be it delving into philosophy, spirituality, or the introspective journey of self-discovery, I seek to create meaning in relationships, cherish experiences, and contribute to the world.

### A Personal Odyssey with "Own Appeal"

Oddisee's "Own Appeal" transcends a mere rap track; it mirrors my musings on existence. "I never asked to be born, and death's no question" catalyzes a personal odyssey, prompting me to navigate the nuances of my own narrative. Embracing life's uncharted and inevitable aspects, I resonate with Oddisee's profound exploration of existence through this singular line.
