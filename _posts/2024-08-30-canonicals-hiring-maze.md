description: An in-depth look at Canonical's unique hiring process and why they always seem to have many open positions
---

Ever thought about working for the company behind Ubuntu? Well, buckle up, because Canonical's hiring process is quite the ride. And have you noticed how they always seem to have a ton of open positions? Let's dive into what you might expect if you decide to throw your hat in the ring and explore why their job board looks like a never-ending buffet of opportunities.

## The Gauntlet Begins

First things first: Canonical doesn't do things by halves. Their hiring process is like the tech world's version of an ultra-marathon. We're talking about a journey that can last anywhere from 2 to 5 months. Yep, you read that right ‚Äì months, not weeks [[1]](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Canonical-Interview-Questions-E230560.htm)[[6]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36667863).

Here's a taste of what you might encounter:

1. A written essay (think high school flashbacks)
2. Personality tests (because why not?)
3. Intelligence tests (flex those brain muscles!)
4. Multiple interviews (like, a lot of them ‚Äì some folks report up to 15!)
5. Technical assessments (gotta prove those coding chops)
6. Presentations (time to dust off those public speaking skills)

Multiple applicants have reported going through "months of tests, interviews", with some even making it all the way to an interview with Mark Shuttleworth himself. One HackerNews user described the process as "relatively lengthy," noting that by the time they reached the offer stage, they were already interviewing with other companies [[6]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36667863).


## The Good, The Bad, and The... High School Grades?

Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room ‚Äì or should I say, the penguin? üêß Canonical seems to have a peculiar fascination with your academic past. And I'm not just talking about your university days. Nope, they want to know about your high school glory days too [[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/thsrcp/this_was_the_first_stage_of_the_interview_process/)[[6]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=#36667863).
Picture this: You're a seasoned dev with years of experience under your belt, and you're asked about your high school math ranking. It's like applying for a F1 race and being quizzed about your first bicycle. As one HackerNews commenter put it, "...the interview only really focused on what I had done in high school. I graduated 36 years ago - I just don't see the relevance..." [[6]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36667863)

## The Mixed Bag of Experiences

Some folks actually enjoy this process. They say it gives them a chance to really show off their skills and get to know the company. Others... well, let's just say they're less enthusiastic.

On the plus side, you might get to chat with some cool people from different departments and countries. On the downside, you might feel like you're stuck in an endless loop of interviews and tests [[3]](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Canonical-Interview-Questions-E230560.htm).

## The Compensation Conundrum

After all this, you'd expect a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, right? Well, according to some reviews, Canonical's compensation isn't always competitive. Some candidates have reported being offered contractor positions with limited benefits [[4]](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Canonical-Interview-Questions-E230560.htm).

## The Perpetual Job Fair: Why So Many Open Roles?

Now, here's something that might make you scratch your head: Canonical always seems to have a ton of open positions. It's like they're hosting a never-ending job fair. But why? ü§î

There are a few theories floating around:

1. **The Marathon Effect**: Remember that ultra-marathon hiring process we talked about? Well, it turns out that when you take 2-5 months to hire someone, positions tend to stay open for a while. It's simple math ‚Äì the longer the process, the more open roles you'll see at any given time [[1]](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Canonical-Interview-Questions-E230560.htm)[[6]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36667863).

2. **The Goldilocks Syndrome**: Some folks suggest that Canonical might be looking for candidates that are juuuust right. With their extensive testing and interview process, they might be setting the bar sky-high, making it tough to find the perfect fit [[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/thsrcp/this_was_the_first_stage_of_the_interview_process/).

3. **The Revolving Door Theory**: A few reviews hint at a high turnover rate. If people are leaving as fast as they're being hired, that would explain the constant stream of job openings [[3]](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Canonical-Interview-Questions-E230560.htm).

4. **The Growth Spurt Hypothesis**: On a more positive note, maybe Canonical is in a phase of rapid expansion. All those open roles could be a sign of a company that's growing faster than it can hire [[4]](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Canonical-Interview-Questions-E230560.htm).

5. **The Fishing Expedition**: Here's a spicy theory ‚Äì some suggest that not all these jobs are real. There's speculation that Canonical might be using job postings to gather industry insights or ideas. It's a controversial idea, and definitely not confirmed, but it's out there [[5]](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Canonical-Interview-Questions-E230560.htm).

Now, it's important to note that these are theories based on various reviews and discussions. Canonical itself hasn't officially commented on this phenomenon. But it does make you wonder, doesn't it?

## The Million-Dollar Question

So, here's the big question: Should you apply for a role at Canonical?

Well, that depends. Are you up for an adventure? Do you have a few months to spare? Are you cool with digging up your old report cards? If you answered yes to all of these, then hey, why not give it a shot?

But if you're looking for a quick and straightforward hiring process, or if you believe your recent work speaks louder than your high school grades, you might want to think twice.

At the end of the day, it's all about what you're comfortable with. Canonical's process is unique, that's for sure. Whether it's uniquely good or uniquely frustrating ‚Äì well, that's for you to decide.

What do you think? Would you be willing to go through Canonical's hiring maze? Or would you rather stick to more conventional job applications? And what's your take on their always-full job board? Drop your thoughts in the comments below!
