<p>I am a full-stack developer from Nairobi Kenya, who loves to write software to build great products and help businesses achieve their goals. I appreciate good design and I am seeing it's importance more than ever in todays applications.</p>

<p>I find programming an amazing way to exercise my problem solving skills and I'm always excited about learning new technologies.</p>

<p>I enjoy teaming up with like-minded individuals in bringing the craziest ideas to life and contributing to open-source projects. I believe nothing really interesting is ever built alone!</p>

<p>In my free time, you will find me playing video games, playing football, rock climbing, cycling and doing some photography. I also like foreign languages and am currently putting a lot of effort into becoming fluent in German.</p>
