<p>
I'm a software engineer with over five years of experience building scalable backend systems, primarily in Rust, TypeScript, and Python. I enjoy working on developer tools, performance-critical services, and privacy-first infrastructure.

<p>
Outside of work, you'll find me training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, exploring self-hosted tools, or tinkering with side projects that bridge code and creativity. I care deeply about thoughtful design, well-tested code, and using technology to make systems more fair and accessible.
